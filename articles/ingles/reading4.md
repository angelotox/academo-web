# Key Biblical Concepts: Passages from the Gospels and Paul

Santiago 1:19

My dear brothers and sisters, take note of this: quick to listen,  slow to speak and  slow to become angry, because human anger does not produce the righteousness that God desires. ⚖️   

Matthew 5:14-16

You are the light of the world.  A town built on a hill cannot be hidden. 15 Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house.  In the same way, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven. ✨   

Matthew 16:19

I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven;  whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you untie on earth will be untie in heaven. Mark 11:24   

Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours. ✨   

Paul romans letters 8- 11

Those who live according to the flesh have their minds set on what the flesh desires; but those who live in accordance with the Spirit have their minds set on what the Spirit desires.  The mind governed by the flesh is death, but the mind governed by the Spirit is life and peace. ️ 7 The mind governed by the flesh is hostile to God; it does not submit to God’s law, nor can it do so.!Those who are in the realm of the flesh cannot please God. ❌❤️‍
