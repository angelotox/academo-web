# Separating the Wheat from the Chaff

Separating the Wheat from the Chaff🌾

When we begin to walk the paths of knowledge, it is very important to learn to discern the messages and teachings from both books and wise men.📖📚🧙🏼‍♂️
It is important to emphasize that all the knowledge that comes into our hands comes through a long space-time journey where it is normal for the original message to be lost or distorted.
Hence, even in the Bible (which, by the way, is one of the books that has suffered the most distortions), it says in Luke 3:17 "you will learn to separate the wheat from the chaff."

This means that not everything that is taught, seen, heard, or read, is the absolute truth.
 It is necessary to learn to discern and look carefully at the learning processes from a critical perspective🤔. 
Therefore , common sense will be our best ally. To mention an example.

Saint Thomas Aquinas, is one of the most recognized doctors of the church, and great advances in science and medieval philosophy are due to his studies on Aristotle and other wise men of ancient Greece. However, he held horrible misogynistic theories such as "woman is the product of corrupt see " how can such an intelligent and supposedly enlightened person hold such an infamy?🧐
Another great example is that of the "favorite ephebes" in ancient Greece, many teachers of philosophy, who spoke about virtue and will in the face of temptations, used to select among their youngest students, lovers who were called "ephebes".
With these two examples I want to show you that discernment, common sense, and intuition will always be the best tools when diving into the fascinating world of knowledge. This is why I am also in total disagreement with the current education systems in which we educate to repeat, but not to discern.📄
Not all that glitters is gold.🪙
