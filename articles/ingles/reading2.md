# Giving advices to people

My families is one of the wealthiest of the country, my dad is the owner ok dum dum costrutions and he is part of the republican members.  Despite of this, I meet a girl in vietnam, she is humble perhaps she is not acceptable to the beauty standards of my society  circle.  I love her, but if I take that risk I have to be willing to lose  it everything. What should I do?
By the way she is comusist

I have a handsome boyfriend, he is very kind with me , but he is always dealing with economic struggles , I found a job, and there I meet someone, he is very sexi and he has a lot of money, we gave us a kiss in the chrismast office's party.  I am very concerned and confused.  What should I do?

I am 50 years old , and I might say that I have a perfect family, I work in the same company since I was 25. I Have two daughters, and my wife is a beautiful girl.  Even though, I feel extremely bored with my life. In my dreams I go away with my best friend Estephano and we ride horses together....
