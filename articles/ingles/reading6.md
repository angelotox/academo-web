#talking with a close friend

-I can't..... I can't *go on*
All this issues, *seems*  to be *heavier* each day.  
Every single day, is harder to *bear* it.
You know I am trying to use all my strength, but I feel I can't. 

-donâ€™t say that....there's *still* many things to do. I know you're carrying with a rude load. But , Do you remember that day, when you *were* just a little girl, and you were scare, hidden under your bed *cause* your parents were fighting? I was *besides* you. And we talked for a *while* . I told you that struggles are impossible to *avoid* due to the lessons that we must learn during this life's *journey* but the only way to *overcome* It is understanding that is just and existential game , in witch there are many levels to face. *As* the one you are facing right now.  So, my little girl , here is not about *gathering* all your strength, but to *gather* all your soul's wisdom . 
Look, people, often hurts each others not because there are evil in essence, but because there are ignorants. *Therefore* ignorance is so harmful, and when we are aware of this common ignorance shared by the human kind, we start to be *willing* to forgive . That's way my master said on the cross , "forgive them father, 'cause they don't know what they do"
